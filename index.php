        <p>My name is Francisco Diez, I'm a biomedical engineering undergraduate at Universidad Nacional de CÃ³rdoba, Argentina ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·ðŸ§‰</p>
        <p>I was always passionate about software development, and ever since I started my studies in the medical field engineering, I became really interested in software development applied to medical pourposes and data science.</p>
        <p>That's why I started, parallel to my university studies, my own learning path with different online courses and books. Now I'm studiying C and Python with a data science approach.</p>
